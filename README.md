# About AdEMNEA
Adaptive Environmental Monitoring Networks for East Africa (AdEMNEA) Project is a
combined research and capacity development project funded by the Norwegian Agency for
Development Cooperation, (Norad) under the Norwegian Programme for Capacity Development
in Higher Education and Research for Development (NORHED II). It is a cooperation between
Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU (leading institution), Makerere
University in Uganda (leading southern institution), the University of Juba in South Sudan,
Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) in Tanzania, University of Bergen, Norway.

This project will design, develop, and deploy a flexible network of data gathering and
monitoring stations for meteorological data as well as a wide variety of data including audio,
image, and video data as well as field reports and telemetry data, integrating both existing
sensing platforms and customized components for specific research areas. This is targeting the
thematic sub-area Climate Change and Natural Resources.

These data points will be aggregated through resilient and energy-efficient ICT networks from
the field to researchers conducting data analysis using machine learning, pattern recognition,
and other artificial intelligence and analytical methods in order to support researchers in the
application domain.

The targeted application domains will be weather monitoring, building on the results and
infrastructure established in the NORHED WIMEA-ICT project, and using this data together with
the additional sensing and measurement sources to support researchers initially in the
entomology domain. Both weather monitoring and the direct analysis of the presence,
prevalence, and behavior of pollinators and pests will offer important insights into the effects of
climate change on natural resources for both the natural environment and particularly
agriculture.

The expected Project goal is improved insect pest (Mango Fruit Flies) control and insect
pollinator (bee) biodiversity conservation through Automated Continuous and Systematic
Species Monitoring across wild and agricultural landscapes. It is anticipated to contribute to
increasing Agricultural yields in the partner countries.


## The planned effects for the target group of the Project (Outcomes) are:
● Design an energy-efficient and resilient environment monitoring network, tolerant to
faults or manipulation of its components
● To develop sensors and data processing methods supporting real-time identification,
counting and tracking of insects that are key agents in the pollination process or crop
pests as well as the ambient environment variables where the insects appear.
● Build up the logistic framework to allow for an efficient analysis and dissemination of
information relevant for pollination and pest control
● To design and developed an efficient system for disseminating pollinator and pest
control relevant information for stakeholders in East Africa
● To undertake gender balanced capacity development through MSc. and PhD (seven
Ph.D. and seven MSc. Students) training in relevant disciplines. The relevant disciplines
include Entomology, communication technologies, artificial intelligence and
meteorology
