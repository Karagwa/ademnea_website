She is a keen researcher who finds work within collaborative partnerships exciting. She is currently a senior Lecturer in Computer Networks at Makerere University and leads the WIMEA-ICT lab where research in low-cost automatic weather stations, forecast modeling and software development for weather services are conducted. In these research efforts she works with colleagues and students from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan, Rwanda, South Africa, Sweden and Norway. She has undertaken multi-disciplinary studies with colleagues from the Health, Meteorology, Agriculture and Electrical Engineering disciplines. Her research team has won research grants from a number of Development agencies, resulting into capacity building of several university departments. She has published widely in international peer reviewed journals and conferences and supervised various graduate students. Julianne received a PhD in Communications Networks from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, after studying “Internet High-speed Data Transport Protocols”. Prior to that she had completed a MSc. in Computer Science and a BSc. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Makerere University. Her current research interests are ICT4Development, Internet-of-things for developing regions, Communications Network Protocol Design, telecommunication policies analysis, Quality of Service, Quality of Experience and Systems Security. She also serves on several boards including that of Research and Education Network for Uganda (RENU) and the UbuntuNet Alliance.
